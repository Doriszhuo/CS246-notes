# Lecture 12
## Last time
  - Distructors
  - Copy assignment operators

```c++
Node n2 = plusOne(n); (temporary)
tmp = ........
Node n2 = tmp;//2 copy constructros calls
```

In c++11, rvalue references can be used to indicate temporary objects (Node &&)

-------------

## Move Constructor
```c++
classes / rvalue / nodemove.cc (in interminal)
       
struct Node{
  Node(Node &&others)
    : data{others.data}, next{others.next}{
    others.next = nullptr;
  }
};
```  

## Move Assignment Operator
```c++
Node m;
m = plusOne(n);// call operators, call copy constructor, plusOne(n) is rvalue
       
// Since rhs is a temp, let's steal
         
struct Node{
  Node &Operator = (Node &&others){
    swap(others);
    return *this;
  }
};
```           
           
If a move constructor/move assignment operators are implemented, these are called when the RHS is a rvalue\
 
## Copy / Move Elision
 
```c++ 
Vec makeAvec() {return {0,0};}  // (basic constructor)

Vec v = makeAVec(); // either copy constructor or move constructor
```

When you run this, only basic constructor runs;
  
the values `{0,0}` get written directly into variable

```c++
void doSomething(Vec v){
  ...
  ...
  ...
  ...
}
  
doSomething(makeAVec()); // (only basic constructor runs)
```

__NOTE:__In certain situations, c++ allows compilers to skip copy/move constructors, even if they have side effects

We are expected to know that it is possible, not exactly when it will occur

To close this option, we can use "-fno-elide-constructors" to compiler

## Rule of 5

If you need to write a custom version of:

__correctness__
  - copy constructor
  - distructor                             
  - copy assignment operators
  
__efficiency__     
  - move constructor
  - move assignment operator               
     
then you usually have to write all 5
     

__Note__: Assignment operators must be implemented as a method

Previously, we implemented + or * for Vec as functions

When you implement an operator as a method

```c++
Vec v{1,2};
Vec v{3,4};
Vec v2 = v + v1*k;

Struct vec{
  int x,y;
       
  vector operators+(const vec &others){
    return {x + others.x, y+others.y};
  }
  
  Vec operators*(const int k){
    return {x*k, y*k};
  }
};
     
Vec operators*(const int k, const vec &others){
  return v*k;
}
```
       
Input / Output Operators as methods
```c++
Struct vec{
  ostream &operators<<(ostream &out){
    out << x << " " << y;
    return out;
  }
};
       
 Vec v; 
 v << cout;        v.operator<<(cout);
 v1 << (v << cout) disgusting
```

In C++, following operators must be implemented as methods
  - operators =
  - operators []
  - operators ->
  - operators ()
  - operators T()    ---- akkiws unokucut cibcersuib from Class to type T
      
## Arrays of Objects
```c++
Struct Vec{
  int x,y;
  Vec(int x, int y) : x{x}, y{y}{}
};
     
Vec vectors[3]    // X won't compile
Vec *vecs - new Vec[3] //  X won't compile
```

Trying to default construct elements of array

Options
  1. provide default (0 parameter) constructor
  2. for stack allocated arrays
    ```c++
    Vec vectors[3] = {Vec{0,1}, Vec{1,2}, Vec{3,4}};
    ```
  3. for stack/heap arrays
        
     create arrays of Vec pointers
        
```c++
Vec *vp[10] // stack allocated array for 10 Vec pointers

Vec ** arr = new Vec *[10];
arr[0] = new Vec{1,2};
  ...
  ...
  ...
for (int i=0; int i<10; i++) delete arr[i];
delete [] arr;
```

## Seperate Compilation with Classes
```c++
.h ____ type defs of function headers

.cc ____ implementation
```

Place only the method headers in the header file
```c++
classes/seperate/node.h
                /node.cc
                 
"Node.h"
#ifndef NODE_H
#define NODE_H

struct Node{
  int data;
  Node *next;
  Node (int data, Node *next);
  Node (const Node &others);
};
       
#endif
       
   
"Node.cc"
Node::#include "node.h"
Node(int data, Node *next)
  :data{data}, next{next}{}
```

`::` scope resolution operators 

In the scope of class Node, there is a method called Node

## Const Methods

```c++
Struct Student {
  int assns, mt, final;
  float grade() const {
    return assns*0.4 + mt*0.2 + final*0.4;
  }
};
       
const Studnet billy{70,70,70};

billy.grade(); // (won't compile because grade doesn't promise that it won't change any fields.
```

In C++, a method can process int to change any field by declaring the method const

`billy.grade()` works after adding const next to `float grade()`;

compiler __DOES__ check that you don't change field values
